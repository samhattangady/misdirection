# misdirection

Misdirection is a game made for the Thinky Puzzle Game Jam 2
(https://itch.io/jam/thinky-puzzle-game-jam-2).
In this, we control a magician and her assistant, and it is the role of
the magician to misdirect the attention of the audience until the assistant
can perform some tasks.

The game is mainly controlled from a top down view, and as a mechanic, the
player draws lines, which represents the paths that the magician and her
assistant will follow. There will also be a bunch of audience AI, and they
will be roaming around the scene, and their attention will be drawn by
various actions performed by the magicianand assistant. The goal would 
therefore be for all the attention to be drawn only by the magician, and 
none by the assistant.

At a high level, the main thing we want to explore is colonizing space in
a temporal manner. Which means that the timing at which events occur matters
based on the space that they occupy. So we might have to waste some time on
the part of one of the controlled characters so that the other can get
something done in the other space. It's a little hard to describe in words. 

Note that this is just the idea before we have even touched the  game. So lets
see where it all goes.
