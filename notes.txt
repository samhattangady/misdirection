So we just spent some time figuring out how to set up zig to work correctly
with raylib, but it turns out that the raylib build process for web is via all
the emscripten jank, and I don't feel like doing that when I have a perfectly
good renderer right here.

So we're back here, and we've done some tweaking to clean up the zig-sdl base,
and we can start off working. What's the first thing that we should probably
do though?

I think a good place to start off would be the path drawing maybe? So create a
character. Then attach a path to them. And then draw that path, and figure out
how you can do that bit. Okay lets go.
