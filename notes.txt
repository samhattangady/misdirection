So we just spent some time figuring out how to set up zig to work correctly
with raylib, but it turns out that the raylib build process for web is via all
the emscripten jank, and I don't feel like doing that when I have a perfectly
good renderer right here.

So we're back here, and we've done some tweaking to clean up the zig-sdl base,
and we can start off working. What's the first thing that we should probably
do though?

I think a good place to start off would be the path drawing maybe? So create a
character. Then attach a path to them. And then draw that path, and figure out
how you can do that bit. Okay lets go.

Okay. Lets get back to it then. What is the thing that we want to implement
now?

So how do we want the audience to behave? We could have it such that they move
around. But where do they move around? Ideally, there will be some audience
zone, and they should not be allowed to leave that zone. So if there is any
activity in their bubble, that would cause them to move towards our character.
If they spot the assistant moving around, then game over.

This just feels a little more action than puzzle. Though the controls are
puzzlish. So what is the alternative in that regard?Â 

I am not sure which option is more interesting? Where they travel at the same
speed, or they travel the distance over the same time...
If they are at the same speed, I think it makes some things easier to think
about?
